SSH keys are used to access the SSH protocol. SSH leverages a pair of SSH keys to encrypt communication with a remote system. The key pair is cryptographic in nature and made up of a public and private key. The keys work in tandem to provide authentication between the client and the remote system.</description></item><item><title>SSH Authentication</title><link>https://ssham.pacoorozco.info/about/ssh-authentication/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 May 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssham.pacoorozco.info/about/ssh-authentication/</guid><description>SSH authentication is broadly categorized into two types: password-based and public key authentication.
1. Password-based authentication In password-based authentication, the client sends an authentication request to the server which includes the encrypted username and password for the remote server. Upon receipt, the server decrypts the request and validates the credentials in plain text. Once verified, the client is notified of the authentication outcome.
2. Public key authentication Public key authentication — also known as asymmetric encryption — uses a cryptographic key pair which comprises a private and public key on the client system.</description></item><item><title>Why ssham?</title><link>https://ssham.pacoorozco.info/about/why-ssham/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ssham.pacoorozco.info/about/why-ssham/</guid><description>Proper management over any type of resource and its access credentials enables a secure, well controlled environment. You can ensure proper protection of keys with SSH key management — a combination of practices, policies, and tools for establishing secure SSH key usage routines within an organization. SSH key management can significantly enhance organization cybersecurity by protecting networks and systems from both external and insider attacks. It can also help an organization comply with cybersecurity standards, laws, and regulations.</description></item></channel></rss>
