SSH keys are used to access the SSH protocol. SSH leverages a pair of SSH keys to encrypt communication with a remote system. The key pair is cryptographic in nature and made up of a public and private key. The keys work in tandem to provide authentication between the client and the remote system.\nSSH keys grant users access to critical systems such as cloud and on-premise servers. Typically, these are systems that should only be accessed by authorized users, and no one else. A couple of methods exist for accessing the SSH protocol – passwords and SSH keys. It is not recommended to use passwords because their level of security is relatively low. SSH keys on the other hand can be a very secure method because they are made up of very long strings of composite numbers and prime factors. This is more challenging to crack than passwords, and is why SSH keys are favored over passwords for authenticating to the SSH protocol.\nBefore we proceed further, let us draw a distinction between public and private keys.\nPrivate and Public SSH Keys As the name suggests, the private key is only meant for the person who created it, and therefore strictly resides on the client system. It allows users to securely authenticate with the remote server, and should always be kept secret and never disclosed to anyone. In the wrong hands, the private key could be compromised and malicious users can use it to breach your systems. We cannot emphasize this enough: the private key should never be revealed to anyone else.\nOn the other hand, the public key can be freely shared with any server you wish to connect to without compromising your identity. It is used for encrypting data exchanged between the server and the client. The private key decrypts the messages sent from the remote server and a connection is established. On the remote system, the public key is saved in the authorized_keys file.\n","description":"Secure Shell, or Secure Socket Shell — commonly abbreviated as SSH — is a secure network protocol that allows users to securely authenticate to remote devices.

Password-based authentication In password-based authentication, the client sends an authentication request to the server which includes the encrypted username and password for the remote server. Upon receipt, the server decrypts the request and validates the credentials in plain text. Once verified, the client is notified of the authentication outcome.\n2. Public key authentication Public key authentication — also known as asymmetric encryption — uses a cryptographic key pair which comprises a private and public key on the client system. After generating the SSH key pair, both the public and private keys are saved on the client. The client then copies the public key to the remote server. So, how does the authentication really work?\nDuring authentication, the client system sends an authentication request to the remote server which includes a public key. The remote server then receives the request and checks if the public key matches the one copied to it. If the key is valid and matches the one on the server, the server then creates a secret message and encrypts it with the public key from the client. The message is then sent back to the client whereupon the private key decrypts the message. Because this is asymmetric encryption, only the client system can decrypt the message with the private key. Once the message is decrypted, the server acknowledges it and the authentication is successful.\nPublic key authentication is the more preferred authentication of the two. It is more convenient and secure than password-based authentication — and for good reasons. SSH keys are complex and difficult to crack thanks to the strong encryption algorithms used. In addition, only the user with the private key can access the remote system.\nWhen public key authentication is enabled, password authentication should be turned off so that only the private key alone can be used to authenticate with the remote system.\n","description":"SSH authentication is broadly categorized into two types: password-based and public key authentication.\n1.

You can ensure proper protection of keys with SSH key management — a combination of practices, policies, and tools for establishing secure SSH key usage routines within an organization. SSH key management can significantly enhance organization cybersecurity by protecting networks and systems from both external and insider attacks. It can also help an organization comply with cybersecurity standards, laws, and regulations.\nAt its core, SSH key management will help you:\nAccount for all generated SSH keys Ensure that no extra keys are generated except for valid reasons Know who accesses keys and when Avoid reusing keys across systems and users Immediately change or revoke access to keys Without centralized control, you can’t know how many SSH key pairs are in your organization’s network, who uses them, and how. And if you mismanage your SSH keys, it will create severe cybersecurity risks.\nSSH Access Manager - ssham - is a comprehensive access security management platform that permits IT professionals to easily establish and maintain an enterprise-wide SSH access security solution from a central location.\nIt enables a team of system administrators to centrally manage and deploy SSH keys. This app is intended to be used in rather large environment where access to unix accounts are handled with SSH keys.\n1. Find and inventory all SSH keys You can’t protect those SSH keys whose existence you don’t know about. So the first step in managing SSH keys is finding all existing keys and associating them with users and servers.\nYou can discover all existing keys within your IT infrastructure and learn what servers, machines, or systems they have access to. Thus, you can find potential vulnerabilities like duplicate or orphaned keys and fix them, as well as identify who’s using what keys to access which systems.\n2. Implement the principle of least privilege Privileged users should always have access rights only to the data and systems they need for work purposes.\nTo make this happen, configure individual SHH keys for these employees that allow them to access only the systems or machines they need to perform their duties. Also, make sure to review access rights when employees shift to another position. Avoid shared accounts because they make it impossible to identify who used a pair of keys.\n3. Eliminate hard-coded and old SSH keys As we mentioned earlier, SSH keys can be embedded in code or scripts, which can create dangerous backdoors for malware and hackers to exploit. Make sure to check your code for embedded SSH keys, bring them under centralized management, and remove them from applications.\nOld keys include orphaned and forgotten unaudited keys that can be exploited by cybercriminals. To avoid their appearance, it’s essential to:\nTerminate access to remote servers for any accounts associated with employees that leave an organization Keep track of all generated SSH keys Reduce the number of duplicate keys 4. Set clear rules for SSH key use and management Implement an SSH key management policy or make sure your current security policy has all the rules for proper SSH key management. Policies and procedures must establish consistent baseline requirements across all environments where SSH keys are used. These policies should clearly spell out roles and responsibilities to prevent security lapses.\nKey questions to cover with SSH security policies and procedures:\nWho can create keys and for what purposes? - ssham could help to assing roles and groups to define who can create keys and for what purposes. What is the procedure of requesting a pair of keys for an employee? - ssham becomes the tool for creating and distributing keys. How many users can be associated with a single key?- given that ssham makes key creation a really easy task, key sharing is not needed anymore. What should happen to keys when the user associated with them leaves the organization or switches to another position? - ssham will easily revoke these keys.
