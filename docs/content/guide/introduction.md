SSH Access Manager is a comprehensive access security management platform that permits IT professionals to easily establish and maintain an enterprise-wide SSH access security solution from a central location.

It enables a team of system administrators to centrally manage and deploy SSH keys. This app is intended to be used in rather large environment where access to unix accounts are handled with SSH keys.

SSH Access Manager allows you to maintain user public keys. You can organise these keys with group of keys called keyring. Then SSH Access Manager will deploy the keys and/or key rings to specified unix accounts / groups / servers.
